    <ul>
    <li>I was tasked to find out how casual users and members differ in their use of bikes from the company Cyclistic.</li>
    <li>First, I downloaded the data that was to be examined.</li>
    <li>Then, I cleaned the data in the CSV file by removing duplicates and blanks. I continued by checking the overall cohesiveness of the data.</li>
    <li>Next, I thoroughly analyzed the data to find trends.</li>
    <li>Afterwards, I used Tableau to visualize my findings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this information, I would give Cyclistic the following advice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Focus your marketing efforts on the days of the week when people are most likely to ride. The data shows that people ride the most on Saturdays and Sundays.</li>
    <li>This is likely because people have more free time on these days. Cyclistic should focus its marketing efforts on these days in order to attract more riders.</li>
    <li>Offering a variety of pricing plans to appeal to different types of riders. For example, Cyclistic could offer a daily pass or a weekly pass.</li>
    <li>This would make Cyclistic more affordable for casual users who may not want to commit to a monthly or annual membership.</li>
</ul>
