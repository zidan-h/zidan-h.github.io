        <h2>What I am passionate in</h2>
    <p id="summ">I am passionate about using data to uncover insights, solve problems, and make better decisions. <br>
         I enjoy exploring large datasets, developing algorithms and statistical models, and visualizing  <br>
        the results of my analysis in clear and compelling ways. I am particularly interested in applying <br>
        data analysis to real-world problems in fields such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences,  <br>
        and using data-driven approaches to improve the lives of individuals and communities. I am        <br>
        constantly learning new techniques and technologies in data analysis, and I am excited about the  <br>
        potential of this field to drive innovation and progress in the world.</p>
